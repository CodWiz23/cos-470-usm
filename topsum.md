### Lecture summaries

[Lecture 1](https://github.com/jamesquinlan/cos-470-usm/blob/main/lectures/1.tex) covered vectors and distance metrics.  Several examples of distances were provides.

[Lecture 2](https://github.com/jamesquinlan/cos-470-usm/blob/main/lectures/2.tex) covers norms, scalar product, and projection.

[Lecture 3](https://github.com/jamesquinlan/cos-470-usm/blob/main/lectures/3.tex) discussed the ``curse of dimensionality".

[Lecture 4](https://github.com/jamesquinlan/cos-470-usm/blob/main/lectures/4.tex) introduces k-NN algorithm.

[Lecture 5](https://github.com/jamesquinlan/cos-470-usm/blob/main/lectures/5.tex) continues with k-NN, including code and evaluation metrics.
